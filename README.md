**Breakable Bedrock** - Use an efficiency 5 diamond pickaxe, click 15 times on bedrock with full durability to break it. Use silk touch to actually make it drop. Your pickaxe will lose all it's durability after this.

**Staffs** - Place a stick in an anvil and call it either "Doom Staff" or "Lightning Staff". Try left clicking at some targets. The doom staff also supports sneak-left-clicking for an alternative attack. These attacks do cost health.


**Turning coal to diamond** - Punching a block of coal has a 1/200 chance of dropping a diamond per punch.

Write the names of entities to target in a book (use a book and quill) each on their own line. You may use multiple pages. Then sign the book.

Place the written book into a dispenser and then sneak-left-click the dispenser to create a turret. You may now remove the book. The targets are stored in the turret.

**Removing a turret:**
Simply break the turret to remove it.

**Targeting Modes:**

_Sneak-left-click_ your turret to switch targeting modes.

_**All**_ - This targeting mode will target any living entity except for it's owner.

_**Whitelist**_ - This targeting mode will only target the living entities specified. (Except the owner)

_**Blacklist**_ - This targeting mode will  target any living entity not specified in the targets book upon creation. (Except the owner)

**Viewing Turret Stats**

You can view the stats of turrets whether or not you own them. Just sneak-right-click any turret with an empty hand to see its stats.

**Other turret details:**

Turrets will push players back if they get too close and are not the owner.

Turrets protect their inventories from players who aren't their owner.

Turrets will prevent blocks being shift clicked onto them unless it is their owner.

Turrets can be mined by any player regardless of the owner. You should ensure that your turret has a good view of its surrounding to reduce chances of other players mining it.
