Viewing Turret Stats

You can view the stats of turrets whether or not you own them. Just sneak-right-click any turret with an empty hand to see its stats.

Other turret details:

Turrets will push players back if they get too close and are not the owner.

Turrets protect their inventories from players who aren't their owner.

Turrets will prevent blocks being shift clicked onto them unless it is their owner.

Turrets can be mined by any player regardless of the owner. You should ensure that your turret has a good view of its surrounding to reduce chances of other players mining it.
